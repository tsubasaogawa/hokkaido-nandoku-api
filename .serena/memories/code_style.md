# Code Style

The project follows standard Go programming language conventions. The following points should be adhered to:

- Code should be formatted using `gofmt`.
- `go vet` should be used to identify suspicious constructs.
- No specific linter configuration is provided, but it is recommended to follow the guidelines from [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
